# Salesforce Code Test



### Installation

Make sure you have node installed by running
```sh
node -v
```
If you do not have it installed, you can download it here
https://nodejs.org/en/


Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone (this repo)
$ npm install
```

### How to run
As default the secret function is commented out, it is located in the logic.js file under isSecrectAdditive (you can also add your own secret function here).
After adding the secrect function go to the comman line and type
```sh
cd into the directory
app/index.js (add any integer)
```

Also I have included some testing.  If you would like to run the tests type
```sh
npm run test
```
